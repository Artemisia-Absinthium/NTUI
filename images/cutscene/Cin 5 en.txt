Iou : You again ? I thought you had been bitten by a platypus ? 
Sienne : It is right. But the little one one my shoulder got me out of here. Without him I would probably be dead.
Iou : What is this... thing ? 
Sienne : His name is Cathulhu and you should respect him !
Iou : Whatever...  And, what happened to your hem... Second head ?
Sienne : ... Cathulhu was not able to bring her back... Yet.
Iou : Well... As you are the evil one and I am the hero, I suppose I should not let you this opportunity...
Sienne : Evil ? You come, you rampage our offices, our laboratory and our homes, you beat up our team and you team up with a PLATYPUS, and then you dare to call us evil ?
Iou : I'm not the one trying to take over the world...
Sienne : Take over the world ? What the hell...
Ismael : Muahahahaaaa !!
Sienne : Ismael ! I should have guessed... (Quiet, Cathulhu !)
Iou : What the hell..?
Sienne : Ismael was once one of our employees, but he discovered our secret knowledge and tryed to play the god... But it led him to bug and he fled.
Ismael : And now, with you all weakened, nobody will prevent me to take control of all this !
Iou : ...
Sienne : Cathulhu ! Go !
Cathulhu : Myaaaa !
Ismael : Noooo !! Not my hat !!
Iou : Is that the bug ? Funny.
Sienne : Yep. *Smile*
Ismael : I'll be back ! By the way, you should probably mourn stupidly and uselessly for your friend rather than following me...
Iou : Meryl !
...
Meryl : Ah, Iou, you're here ! ... Ooooh... What a cute little thing... Cathulhu, did I hear ?
Cathulhu : Mya !
