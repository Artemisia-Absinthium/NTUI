Iou : A... A two headed monster ? But what the hell are you guys..? Are you all freaks ?
First head : How rude...
Second head : Indeed... You should not insult ladies, especially when you were not presented to them.
First head : By the way, I am called Sienne, and this fine lady goes by the name of Elesia.
Elesia : And you are Mr..?
Iou : The name is Iou.
Sienne : No, you're certainly not me. Too rude.
Iou : *sigh* No. Iou. I - O - U !
Elesia : Strange name...
Iou : Anyway, why do you wear a hood ? And why are you dressed like... a fantaisy monster ?
Sienne : Rude, again ! Well, Elesia decided to quit the team--
Elesia : For personnal reasons.
Sienne : Yes. So, as she cannot leave physically without me, se hide her presence.
Iou : Very effective...
Elesia : Of course it is.
Sienne : And, you're not without knowing about us being in a video game ?
Elesia : I heard about some troubles with some friends of mine... Poor boys...
Iou : The geeks and the jerking board, yes. (Hell yeah I'm funny !)
Sienne : What do you mean, the jerking board ?
Iou : Aragorn,  the board ? No ?
Sienne : He was turn into a board ! That's why he didn't drink the tea I gave him last time ! And now, kids will draw terrible things on him... Poor, poor boy... *sob*
Iou : Whatever... You'll soon join your "poor" friends ! (Now that was more kick ass, I'm getting better !)
Elesia : It would be a pleasure, really, but we have things to do before having time to play. Have a nice day !
Sienne : Don't worry, we'll send you compagny. We're ladies, after all.

Ismael : No, no, you are wrong, young lad. The ninja and the platypus where not my doing.
Meryl : *wink*
Iou : Meryl ?
Meryl : What, did you speak to me ? *smile*
Iou : You're going more and more strange...
